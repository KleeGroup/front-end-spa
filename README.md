# Blank spa application
## Purpose
This application should be both a model and a tutorial for the SPA applications.
It tries to treat as much simple behaviour as possible.
## Skeleton
This is a simple Backbone based skeleton for [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) which utilizes [MarionetteJS](http://marionettejs.com/) and Bootstrap 3.

Main features are [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/),
[Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) and
[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/).
[Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/).

## Getting started
* `npm start` in order tolaunch the brunch server
* Build the project with `brunch b` or `brunch w`.
* Open the `public/` dir to see the result.
* Write your code in `app/`.

## Launch an api in order to simulate the app
* `npm run api` will launch a server on `localhost:8080`

## Generate the code documentation
* `npm run doc` will launch docco and serve it into the docs directory, which is by the way not commited.
